Dramania

Welcome to the Dramania repository! 
Dramania is a party game website where players test out their acting skills in a fun and interactive way. 
Each player receives a unique prompt, challenging them to act out scenarios, characters, or emotions they might never have thought of before. 
Gather a group of friends and dive into this imaginative experience!
